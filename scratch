Messages
    sent in json format? plaintext also in json format?
    plaintext includes timestamp, sender's name, message
    message as sent includes:
        encrypt(plaintext)
        sign(hash(plaintext))
        sign(hash(encrypt(plaintext)))
        sender's name

Client
    End-to-end encryption: sender's client encrypts message for reciever, server never sees plaintext
    Web interface

Server
    methods
        get list of all users
        provide username of requesting user, server returns list (+ nonce) encrypted with their public key
        update
            get new messages
            get which users are currently online
            do this every n seconds
            server remembers how long since each user checked, and uses this to keep track of who's online
        get old messages
            not all at once
            last n messages?
            by date?
        send message
    What library for networking?
        wsgi
        flask
    store user information, messages in a database- use sqlite3
    users added manually to the server for now

From Rayyan:
  -Message Format: [timestamp] username : message
  -Way to encrypt it: take the whole message format and follow the procedure below:
	([timestamp] username : message) -> encrypt -> sign -> send it off!
	-Question: The server doesn't see plaintext, so this must mean that the client does the encrypting, yes?
  -Current progress (2/3/2015): Refreshing memory on digital signatures, tutorial on Javascript, contemplation on outline.
