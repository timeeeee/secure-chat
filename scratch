Client
  End-to-end encryption: sender's client encrypts message for reciever, server doesn't see plaintext
  PGP-like protocol- asymmetric encryption to exchange key for symmetric encryption
  Also arrange symmetric key for server, and use it to encrypt meta-data about messages, like recipient
  GUI or CLI? If in terminal, use ncurses? If graphical, what library?


Server
  Minimum, relays messages from client to client
  How much do we trust the server? Could be a key server, otherwise we will have to enter other users' public keys into the client manually
